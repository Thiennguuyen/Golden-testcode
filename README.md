# Golden-testcode
To run this project at localhost, follow this step:
    - You should have Xampp and start Apache module.
    - Remember to place the back-end folder inside the folder htdocs of Xampp (for me it is C:\xampp\htdocs)
    - Go to the front-end: cd G-sneaker-frontend
    - Install package: npm install
    - Run the command: npm run dev
    - The website will run on http://localhost:5173/

I'm sorry about not providing deployment of the application. This is because I didn't take advantage of the time you give. I will soon update the deploy link to this file. Another thing is the database is mySQL and is provided by an online cloud so the response of api is quite late. Hope you understand this inconvenience.
